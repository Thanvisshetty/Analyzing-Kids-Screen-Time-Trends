# 📊 Kids Screen Time Data Analysis

## 📂 Dataset Used
- **File Name:** `kids_screen_time_dataset (2).csv`
- **Description:** Dataset containing information on children’s average screen time, device usage, parental controls, and effects on kids across different countries.

  - `Gender`
  - `Age` 
  - `Country`
  - `Device used`
  - `Purpose`
  - `Child Name`
  - `Average_Screen_Time_per_Day_Min`
  - `Effect_on_Kid`
  - `Parental_Control`
  - Other demographic and behavioral attributes

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used
### **Tools**
- **Excel** – Initial data cleaning and pivot table creation  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and interactive visualizations (`Power BI.pbix`)  
- **Google collaab** – Data preprocessing and analysis (`Python (1).ipynb`)  

### **Python Libraries**
- `pandas` – Data manipulation  
- `numpy` – Numerical operations  
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – Data visualization

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates  
   - Handled missing values (imputation/removal)  
   - Converted average screen time from minutes to hours  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Descriptive statistics  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Distribution plots of screen time  

3. **Visualization**
   - Created pivot tables in Excel  
   - Built Power BI interactive dashboard  
   - Generated Python plots for trend analysis  

4. **Filtering & Insights**
   - Filtered countries by *Effect_on_Kid* in Power BI  
   - Compared screen time between parental control categories  

---

## 📈 Visualizations Created
- **Excel:** Donut charts comparing “Yes” vs. Grand Total and “No” vs. Grand Total for *Effect on Kid*  
- **Power BI:**  
  - Map visual showing effect on kids by country  
  - Bar charts showing average screen time distribution  
  - Slicers for parental control and effect status  
- **Python:** Histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmap  

---

## 💡 Key Insights from the Data
- Countries with **higher average screen time** often reported **more negative effects** on kids.  
- **Parental control** usage is linked with **lower average screen time**.  
- The **variation in screen time** between countries suggests cultural and lifestyle influences.  
- Visual analysis shows **a concentration of high screen time** in specific geographic regions.
